### Tips

* Remember that you're the quantitative expert and the client depends on you to help them make data-driven decisions.  It's *your* job to provide clarity and knowledge on the topic, and to present statistical arguments such that a non-techincal audience can understand your findings. 

* Although you might want to include figures and tables from an exploratory analysis, this is a report for your customer.  That means you should be labeling axes, titling figures and providing all the information necessary to understand your results, and no more.
