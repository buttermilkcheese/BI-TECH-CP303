This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

# Code chunks

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(carat ~ price, data = diamonds)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. There are lots of different arguments we can give the code
chunks that will change the behavior of how they render:

Table Header | Second Header | Second Header
------------- | ------------- | -------------
eval | TRUE | Whether to evaluate the code and include its results
echo | TRUE | Whether to display code along with its results
warning | TRUE | Whether to display warnings
error | FALSE | Whether to display errors
message | TRUE | Whether to display messages
tidy | FALSE | Whether to reformat code in a tidy way when displaying it
results | "markup" | "markup", "asis", "hold", or "hide"
cache | FALSE | Whether to cache results for future renders
comment | "##" | Comment character to preface results with
fig.width | 7 | Width in inches for plots created in chunk
fig.height | 7 | Height in inches for plots created in chunk

Let's try some and see what happens. Here's a code chunk with just plot size
arguments:
```{r plain-jane, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Don't run the code:
```{r no-run, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
# we get nuthin'
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Don't print warnings:
```{r no-warn, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Automagically tidy up your code:
```{r tidy, tidy = TRUE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

And if you want to skip the code...
```{r no-code, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

# Formatting headers

You can denote different header sizes with '#.'

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

# Formatting text

Make lists with '*'.

* *this text is in italics*
* **this text is bold**
* `this text is in-line code`
* this text has an equation: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$

> This text is a quoteable quote.

You can also make ordered lists naturally like this:

1. Here's an item
2. And the second one
3. The third item has some sub-points
  * great point
  * another great point
  * blah
  
# Tables

You can create your own tables like this:

Table Header | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell | Cell 2
Cell 3 | Cell 4 

Or create them with code!

```{r ktable}
library(knitr)
agg = aggregate(price ~ clarity + color, diamonds, mean)
kable(xtabs(price ~ ., data = agg))
```
